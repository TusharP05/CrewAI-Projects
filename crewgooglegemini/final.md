##  Coronavirus Research: A Comprehensive Review

This document aims to provide students with a comprehensive overview of the current state of coronavirus research. It will cover key findings, relevant research papers, and useful video links. Additionally, it will guide students on how to approach writing their own research papers on this topic. 

### 1) Review of Research Done Till Now

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has spurred a massive global research effort. Key findings include:

* **Viral Transmission:** SARS-CoV-2 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.  [1, 2]
* **Disease Severity:**  The severity of COVID-19 can range from mild to severe, with factors like age, underlying health conditions, and viral variant influencing outcomes. [3]
* **Vaccines:** Several effective vaccines have been developed and deployed, significantly reducing the severity of illness and mortality. [4, 5] 
* **Treatments:** While there is no cure for COVID-19, various treatments have been developed to manage symptoms and reduce complications, including antiviral medications and monoclonal antibodies. [6, 7]
* **Long COVID:** A significant portion of individuals experience persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19 infection, known as Long COVID. Research is ongoing to understand its causes and develop effective treatments. [8]
* **Variants:** SARS-CoV-2 has evolved over time, leading to the emergence of new variants with varying transmissibility, immune evasion, and disease severity. [9]
* **Animal Models:** Animal models have played a crucial role in understanding viral pathogenesis, evaluating vaccine efficacy, and testing potential treatments. [10]
* **Immune Response:** The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is complex and can vary significantly between individuals. Research is ongoing to understand how the immune system responds to the virus and to develop strategies to enhance immune protection. [11]
* **Social and Economic Impacts:** The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on societies and economies worldwide, highlighting the need for preparedness and response strategies for future pandemics. [12]
