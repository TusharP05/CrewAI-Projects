**1) Review of Research done till now**

The current status of Covid-19 research is constantly evolving, with new studies and findings being published regularly. According to a systematic review of the most influential COVID-19 articles, research has focused on the diagnosis, transmission, and therapy of COVID-19 (PMC, 2022). The review highlights the importance of collaboration among researchers and the need for continued investment in COVID-19 research.

A study published in the Journal of Public Health found that three journals accounted for close to 70% of the 108 COVID-19 articles published during the pandemic: IJERPH, JMIRPHS, and Lancet Public Health (MIT Press, 2020). The study also noted that the majority of articles were published in the early stages of the pandemic, highlighting the rapid response of the scientific community.

The top 100 most-cited articles about COVID-19 were analyzed, revealing that leading journals include The Lancet, NEJM, and JAMA, with prominent contributions from Internal Medicine (46.9%) and Pulmonary Medicine (14.5%) (F1000Research, 2022). The study also found that China played a significant role in the global response to the pandemic, with a significant proportion of articles published by Chinese authors.
