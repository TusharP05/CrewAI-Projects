**Review of Research done till now**

The current status of research on female orgasm is a complex and multifaceted topic. Studies have shown that the female orgasm is a highly pleasurable part of sexual activity, and it has been linked to sexual satisfaction, desire, and relationship satisfaction (1, 2). However, there is still a significant gap in our understanding of the female orgasm, and more research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms and importance.

One study found that the duration of the female orgasm can vary from 20-35 seconds (3), while another study found that around 70% of women reach orgasm frequently, but around 10% never do so (4). Vaginal intercourse was reported by 62% of the overall cohort as the best trigger for orgasm (4).

Research has also shown that the female orgasm is not just a physical response, but also a psychological and emotional experience. A study found that women's orgasm frequency was positively related to their relationship satisfaction and mate selection (5).
